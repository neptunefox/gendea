## UX & UI

- Design surfaces so a first-time visitor can act without instructions: group related controls tightly, pair each action with context, and keep spacing consistent so intent reads instantly.
- Always keep momentum visible by showing where someone is in the flow and what the very next step is; proximity between output and action beats distant controls.
- Limit simultaneous decisions on any view; if more options exist, gate them behind filters or tiers so the default state feels calm and obvious.
- When resurfacing saved work, restore its identifiers, timestamps, and contents automatically so the person can continue mid-stream without rebuilding context.
