## Commit Messages

Always generate commit messages following conventional commit format.

Format: `type(scope): description`

Types:
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- refactor: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, whitespace)
- ui: visual/UX changes
- perf: performance improvement
- docs: documentation only
- chore: maintenance tasks

Keep descriptions concise, clear, and in present tense.

When completing spec tasks, include the task/subtask reference.
