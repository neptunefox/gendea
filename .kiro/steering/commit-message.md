## Commit Messages

When a task is completed, generate a commit message that:

- Include task number in the first line
- Summarizes the changes made in the current session
- Uses conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Common types: feat, fix, refactor, chore, docs, style, test
- Keeps the description concise and action-oriented
- References the specific files or features modified

Example: `feat(workflow): add action crisis alternatives endpoint`
